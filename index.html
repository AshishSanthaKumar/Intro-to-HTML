				This visualization depicts the elo rating for every team in the NFL from the team's foundation year to present.
				Elo rating is a simple system that judges the teams based on head-to-head results. In short, this Viz shows the teams'
				performance compared to others in that particular year.

				This thing I like most about this visualization is the User flexibility and the detailing. The ability to filter out 
				data based on user preference definitely tops the list of why I love this visualization. 
				The data being shown is that of the head to head peroformance of a particular team in comparison to all other teams 
				in the league. This Visualization supports various user tasks like Zoom (on clicking a part of the graph), a nice 
				overview, the ability to extract and filter parts of the data and get details on demand. The Years slider at the bottom 
				of the visualization helps in filtering out the years of the Teams' Performance. The Championship years are indicated
				with a Yellow circle.
