# Homework #1: Vis in the wild

The purpose of this assignment is to get you thinking about visualization from a design persepective and to give you a bit of practice and exposure to making a web page.

Find a visualization online somewhere that you think is interesting. Don't just pick a basic bar chart or scatter plot, but look around and see if you can find something that is especially attractive, insightful, moving, or interesting.

Once you've found that, take a screenshot and copy the URL. Use the index.html page in this repository as a base to describe the visualization.

- Add name, title, date, etc.
- Replace the screenshot of Sparky with the one you took and add the name and URL for the visualization.

Replace the Lorem Ipsum paragraphs below with a brief description of the visualization and why you chose it. Mention things like:
- What information or insights does this visualization showing?
- Why do you think this is a good and/or interesting visualization? What do you like about it?
- What is the data being shown?
- What types of user tasks does this visualization support?
